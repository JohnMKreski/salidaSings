            <h1>The Noteables</h1>
            <img src="./src/media/images/theNoteables/2010-Winter-Noteables-04.jpg" class="floatRightWithBorder"/>
            <p>The all women's community chorus was founded in 1988 by director, 
              Georgiana Smith and accompanist/vocalist Jeanne Kostelic during a time when 
              Salida was struggling to recover from the loss of the mining and railroad 
              industries. Other than church choirs there had been relatively few performing 
              groups, so The Noteables were welcomed with open arms and rapidly became 
              the group to contact for special occasions, benefit concerts and Christmas 
              performances.  Although the directors, membership and styles of music have 
              fluctuated throughout the past 30 years, the group has flourished.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Noteables have been under the direction of Linda Taylor since 2008. 
              The chorus presents two concert series annually, each consisting of three 
              concerts, one in December, the other in May.  Membership fluctuates each 
              season ranging from 30-45 singers.  This is a non-audition group and new 
              members are always welcome. Rehearsals for the Christmas season begin in 
              September, for the Spring season in January. The Noteables rehearse on 
              Thursday nights from 5:30-7:30pm. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Christmas programs include a wide variety of sacred and secular selections. 
              Unusual arrangements of familiar carols, Celtic and multi cultural songs, 
              whimsical novelty pieces, gospels, and songs about winter make for a very 
              versatile concert series.  Small ensembles add variety to the concert and 
              give opportunity for more skilled singers.  Most songs are accompanied by 
              piano or CDs. Some songs are sung a cappella and many have additional 
              instrumentation in the form of guitar, flute and percussion. 
              There is something for everyone!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Spring programs also include a wide variety of sacred and secular selections. 
              Easter, Celtic, Broadway and multicultural songs combine with pieces about spring 
              and renewal, spirituals, and just about anything the director wants to try on for size! 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The director is animated and energetic and brings out the best in The Noteables 
              with her creative teaching abilities.  She makes having fun, while learning good 
              vocal technique a priority.  The group loves to move on stage and though the concerts 
              are informal and often engage the audience, the singing still remains at a 
              semi-professional level. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Director</h3>
            <p>Linda Taylor comes from a rich background of music. 
              Pianist, singer, guitarist, director of music theatre and multiple community choruses. 
              She has been giving voice lessons for over 30 years. Her energetic style of direction 
              combines vocal technique, through the use of visualization and breathing exercises with 
              a humorous and heart felt connection with the music. Singing with Linda produces 
              instant results and is great fun.  Her motto is &quot;When in doubt, sing!&quot;
            </p>
